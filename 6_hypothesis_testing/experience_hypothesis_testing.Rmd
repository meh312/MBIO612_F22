Let's use the code provided below to generate a dataset representing two populations, each sampled from a Guassian with a specific population mean. Here I am generating only 5 samples

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 12, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
complete_data
```

* I compute the mean of the dataset above using the following code:
  * feel free to deconstruct the code to see what each chunk does.

```{r}
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 1", ]$measure)
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 2", ]$measure)
```

* Use the `tapply` function instead of the code above to compute the means samples from "Site 1" and those from site 2
  * See tapply for help if needed.

```{r}
# Write your code here
m <- complete_data$measure
s <- complete_data$site_name
tapply(m, s,  mean)
```

Q.2 

* Use the bootstrapping-procedure covered in class to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the data in `Site 1` and that in `Site 2`.

Make sure you follow the approach discussed in class and which consists of:

1. Selecting an appropriate test statistic
2. Bootstrapping a a distribuion for the observed statistic under the null hypothesis
3. Desciding whether to accept or reject the null based on the probability of the null
4. provide a p-value to support your decision.


#### Q2.0 

Complete the following by describing the null and the alternative hypotheses we are testing here.

```{r}
### Write your answer here
# null  hypothesis: there is no significant difference between Site 1 and Site 2
# alternative  hypothesis: there is a significant difference between Site 1 and Site 2
```

#### Q.2.1 

Produce a graph similar the one below (geom_density) display the distributions. If you're using the same seed as mine, your graph will look exactly the same as the one below 

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rz5jxm84kk8ac1m/dist.png?dl=1)

```{r}
# write your code here
(ggplot(complete_data, aes(x=measure, fill=site_name),color='black') + 
  geom_density(adjust=2,alpha=0.5)
+labs(x ="Measure", y = "Density"))+ xlim(5, 19)
```

Q2.2 Select a proper test statistic and produce a distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis. Plot the data as both a histogram and density curves. Your graph may look like this.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jarqg9swneai0r/mean_under_null.png?dl=1)

```{r}
# Write your code here
#let's compare means 
data_3 = rnorm(40, 10, 1)
data_4 = rnorm(40, 12, 1)
mean(data_3) - mean(data_4)
processOneIter = function(data_1, data_2){
    
    concat_data = c(data_1, data_2)
    len_concat_data = length(concat_data)
    
    len_data_1 = length(data_1)    
    shuffled_data = sample(concat_data)
    new_data_1 = shuffled_data[1:len_data_1]
    new_data_2 = shuffled_data[(len_data_1+1):len_concat_data]
    mean(new_data_1) - mean(new_data_2)
    
}
mean_under_null = replicate(1000, processOneIter(data_3, data_4))
mean(mean_under_null)
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(mean_under_null, y=..density..), bins =30, alpha=0.2, color="black") + 
  geom_density(aes(mean_under_null), bw=0.2, size=1.5) + 
  xlim(-10, 10)
```


####  Q2.3. 

Calculate and plot the observed statistic on the graph you created in Q.2.2. 

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = rnorm(5, 10, 1)
data_2 = rnorm(5, 12, 1)
diff_mean=mean(data_1) - mean(data_2)

#now replot
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(mean_under_null, y=..density..), bins =30, alpha=0.2, color="black") + geom_density(aes(mean_under_null), bw=0.2, size=0.5) + xlim(-5, 5) + 
  geom_point(aes(diff_mean, 0), color="red", size=10)


```

#### Q2.4 
compute the p-vlaue of the observed statistic under the null. What do you conclude about the hypotheses you enunciated in Q

```{r}
data = t.test(data_1, data_2)
data$p.value
sum(mean_under_null < diff_mean) / length(mean_under_null)
````
Because the p value is zero, we can reject the null hypothesis. There is no chance that we would see our observed differences in means in a random distribution of datasets with equivalent distributions. Therefore, we can say that the two distributions have different means that are statistically significant.
#### Q.3 

* The proportion of the of _P. lobata_, _M. capitata_ and _P. mendrina_ at a site X are c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21).
* You surveyed site Y with different environmental conditions and obtains the following proportions for the three corals (0.61, 0.19, 0.20). Use the multinomial non-parametric hypotheses test to assess whether the proportions obtained at sites X and Y are statistically different.


Although not explicitly required, your test should cover all the steps in Q2, i.e. appropriate graph(s) when possible, test statistics, and conclusion.

```{r}
kind = c('_P. lobata_', '_P. lobata_', '_M. capitata_','_M. capitata_', 'P. mendrina_', 'P. mendrina_')
ratios = c(0.60, 0.61, 0.19, 0.19, 0.21, 0.20)
method = rep(c("Site X", "Site Y"), 3)


coral_proportions = tibble(kind, ratios, method)
coral_proportions
```

```{r}
ggplot(coral_proportions, aes(fill=method, y=ratios, x=kind)) + 
    geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") + 
    coord_flip()

```
```{r}
subtract = function(x){
    x[1] - x[2]
}

subtract(c(20, 15))
tapply(coral_proportions$ratios, coral_proportions$kind, subtract)

```

```{r}

subtract_abs = function(x){
    abs(x[1] - x[2])
}


sum(tapply(coral_proportions$ratios, coral_proportions$kind, subtract_abs))/2

sample(kind, 200, replace=TRUE, prob=ratios)
rmultinom(1, 200, prob=ratios)
rmultinom(1, 200, prob=ratios)/200


```
```{r}
sampleOneIteration = function(){
    true_proportions = c(0.20, 0.08, 0.12,0.54, 0.06)
    sample_proportions = rmultinom(1, 200, prob=c(0.20, 0.08, 0.12,0.54, 0.06))/200
    sample_tvd = sum(abs(true_proportions- sample_proportions))/2
    sample_tvd
        
}
tvds = replicate(1000, sampleOneIteration())
```

```{r}
sum(tapply(coral_proportions$ratios, coral_proportions$kind, subtract_abs))/2
ggplot()+ 
  geom_histogram(aes(tvds, ..density..), bins = 15) +
  geom_point(aes(observed_stat, 0), size=5, color="red")

```

```{r}
p_value = sum(tvds > observed_stat)  / length(tvds)
p_value
```
Here, we accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference in coral species proportions between site x and site y because the p-value is well over 0.05. There is a very high chance that we would get the observed results if we looked at a randomized distribution of coral species.
