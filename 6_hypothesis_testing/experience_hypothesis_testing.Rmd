Let's use the code provided below to generate a dataset representing two populations, each sampled from a Guassian with a specific population mean. Here I am generating only 5 samples

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 12, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
complete_data
```

* I compute the mean of the dataset above using the following code:
  * feel free to deconstruct the code to see what each chunk does.

```{r}
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 1", ]$measure)
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 2", ]$measure)
```

* Use the `tapply` function instead of the code above to compute the means samples from "Site 1" and those from site 2
  * See tapply for help if needed.

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

Q.2 

* Use the bootstrapping-procedure covered in class to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the data in `Site 1` and that in `Site 2`.

Make sure you follow the approach discussed in class and which consists of:

1. Selecting an appropriate test statistic
2. Bootstrapping a a distribuion for the observed statistic under the null hypothesis
3. Desciding whether to accept or reject the null based on the probability of the null
4. provide a p-value to support your decision.

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 13, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
```

#### Q2.0 

Complete the following by describing the null and the alternative hypotheses we are testing here.

```{r}
### Write your answer here
```

#### Q.2.1 

Produce a graph similar the one below (geom_density) display the distributions. If you're using the same seed as mine, your graph will look exactly the same as the one below

```{r}
# write your code here
```

Q2.2 Select a proper test statistic and produce a distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis. Plot the data as both a histogram and density curves. Your graph may look like this.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

####  Q2.3. 

Calculate and plot the observed statistic on the graph you created in Q.2.2. 

```{r}
#### Q2.4 
compute the p-vlaue of the observed statistic under the null. What do you conclude about the hypotheses you enunciated in Q
```

#### Q.3 

* The proportion of the of _P. lobata_, _M. capitata_ and _P. mendrina_ at a site X are c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21).
* You surveyed site Y with different environmental conditions and obtains the following proportions for the three corals (0.61, 0.19, 0.20). Use the multinomial non-parametric hypotheses test to assess whether the proportions obtained at sites X and Y are statistically different.


Although not explicitly required, your test should cover all the steps in Q2, i.e. appropriate graph(s) when possible, test statistics, and conclusion.
